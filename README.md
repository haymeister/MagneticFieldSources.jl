# MagneticFieldSources
A Julia module for modeling basic magnetic field sources

Models are provided for 
* ideal point dipoles
* [finite continuous solenoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid#Finite_continuous_solenoid)

The [Quaternions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/Quaternions.jl)
package is used for source rotation.
